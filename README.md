# x-namespace

under development, use at your own risk !

```cpp
constexpr const char* logo = R"(
        :::    ::: ::::    :::  ::::::::
       :+:    :+: :+:+:   :+: :+:    :+:
       +:+  +:+  :+:+:+  +:+ +:+
       +#++:+   +#+ +:+ +#+ +#++:++#++

");
```

`xnamespace` - a riddle wrapped in a mystery, shrouded in an enigma. It's a C++ library of an intensely personal kind.

## Foreword

Before you venture further, know this: I am a developer plagued by a severe, incurable condition - Dependency Phobia. This affliction compels me to staunchly resist any inclusion of external code into my projects. Hence, `xnamespace` was born out of this constraint.
